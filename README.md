# 🧠 Artificial Neural Network from Scratch

Welcome to this repository! 🎉 It contains an implementation of an **Artificial Neural Network (ANN)** built entirely from scratch using **Python** and **NumPy**. This project is inspired by the awesome concepts and implementation details from the article [*Understand and Implement an Artificial Neural Network from Scratch*](https://tinztwinshub.com/data-science/a-beginners-guide-to-developing-an-artificial-neural-network-from-zero/) by Tinz Twins Hub. 🚀

## 🌟 Overview

This project is all about diving deep into the magic of artificial neural networks! Here’s what you’ll explore:

- **🧩 Perceptron and Feedforward Propagation**: The building blocks of neural networks.
- **📉 Gradient Descent for Error Minimization**: How the network learns to get better.
- **🔄 Backpropagation to Update Weights**: Fine-tuning the model step-by-step.
- **💻 Implementation of ANN with NumPy**: Pure, from-scratch coding goodness!

You’ll find examples showing how to:
- Generate a toy dataset 🗃️
- Build and train your neural network ⚙️
- Evaluate its performance 📊
- Play with parameters like learning rate, hidden nodes, and iterations 🔧
